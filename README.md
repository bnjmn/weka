weka (mirror)
=============

**NOTE** The [owner][bnjmn] of this repository has no affiliation with official
WEKA project. This repo is periodically updated as a kindness to others who
have shown interest in it. It can take several hours to `checkout` the full
official WEKA subversion repository and several minutes just to update with any
new commits. Therefore, this exists to provide an easy way to access and peruse
the WEKA source using git, nothing more.

---

This is a git mirror of the [The University of Waikato][uofw] machine learning
project [WEKA][weka-home].

> Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
> The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from
> your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
> classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
> It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

The official WEKA source code is hosted using subversion at the [Waikato SVN
server][weka-source].

The current version of WEKA is licensed under the [GNU General Public license
version 3.0][gnu-v3].

Use the [weka-trunk][weka-trunk-branch] branch to follow the official code base
under active development at the University of Waikato.
