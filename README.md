weka (mirror) 
=============

This is a git mirror of the [The Univserity of Waikato][uofw] machine learning
project [WEKA][weka-home].

> Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
> The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from
> your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
> classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
> It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

The official WEKA source code is hosted using subversion at the [Waikato SVN
server]( https://svn.cms.waikato.ac.nz/svn/weka/). 

The current version of WEKA is licensed under the [GNU General Public license
version 3.0][gnu-v3].
