# Description (required)
Description=Extension of BestFirst. Takes a restricted number of k attributes into account. Fixed-set selects a fixed number k of attributes, whereas k is increased in each step when fixed-width is selected. The search uses either the initial ordering to select the top k attributes, or performs a ranking (with the same evalutator the search uses later on). The search direction can be forward, or floating forward selection (with opitional backward search steps). For more information see: Martin Guetlein (2006). Large Scale Attribute Selection Using Wrappers. Freiburg, Germany.
