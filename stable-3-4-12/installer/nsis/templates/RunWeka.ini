# Contains the commands for running Weka either with a command prompt
# ("cmd_console") or without the command prompt ("cmd_default").
# One can also define custom commands, which can be used with the Weka
# launcher "RunWeka.class". E.g., to run the launcher with a setup called
# "custom1", you only need to specify a key "cmd_custom1" which contains the
# command specification.
#
# Notes: 
# - This file is not a DOS ini file, but a Java properties file.
# - The settings listed here are key-value pairs, separated by a "=". Every
#   key can only be listed ONCE.
