Description=Provides a wrapper classifier for feedforward networks, including convolutional networks, trained using the Deeplearning4j library. Do *not* install this package directly, instead install either wekaDeeplearning4jCPU (for CPU-based processing) or wekaDeeplearning4jGPU (for GPU-accelerated processing).

Changes=Code refactoring and clean-up. More options. Bug fixes: last mini batch was skipped in instance-based dataset iterators; serialization now also works in FilteredClassifier, etc.
