Description=Integration with CPython for Weka. Python version 2.7.x or higher is required. Also requires the following packages to be installed in python: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn. This package provides a wrapper classifier and clusterer that, between them, cover 60+ scikit-learn algorithms. It also provides a general scripting step for the Knowlege Flow along with scripting plugin environments for the Explorer and Knowledge Flow.

Changes=Now includes support for xgboost (classification and regression). Note that xgboost is *not* included in scikit-learn, but does have a sklearn API. This means that the user must install the xgboost package in their python distribution.
