1. Directories
==============
In the following some information on the directories of this project:

- "lib"
  In order to compile the examples, you need to place a weka.jar in this
  directory. You can either do this manually, or if you have WEKA's source
  code as separate project, you can use the ant build file's "update"
  target:
     ant -Dweka=/path/to/weka/project update
  If you are using examples that are accessing a database via JDBC, you will
  need to add the necessary JDBC driver jar in this directory as well.
     
- "src/java"
  This directory contains the Java examples. For details on using WEKA's API, 
  see wiki article "Use Weka in your Java code":
    http://weka.wiki.sourceforge.net/Use+Weka+in+your+Java+code

- "src/groovy"
  Here you can find the Groovy examples. For details on using Groovy, see wiki 
  article "Using Weka from Groovy":
    http://weka.wiki.sourceforge.net/Using+Weka+from+Groovy
  
- "src/jython"
  The Jython examples are stored in this directory. For details on using 
  Jython, see wiki article "Using Weka from Jython":
    http://weka.wiki.sourceforge.net/Using+Weka+from+Jython


2. Compiling/running examples
=============================
Some of the examples cannot be run straight away, as they require setting up
first. This applies, for instance, to the Java WEKA converter examples that 
are accessing a database. By default, these examples do not contain any
JDBC URLs, user names or passwords.

Also, a lot of the examples require command-line parameters as they load and/or
process data. Check out the documentation of the specific source code that you 
are interested in.


3. Eclipse
==========
Since there are quite a Groovy and Jython scripts available, you should consider
installing the appropriate Eclipse plugins:
- Groovy
  http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/update/
- Python
  http://pydev.sourceforge.net/updates/

Eclipse users can then just rename the .classpath-default and .project-default 
files (by removing the "-default") and then import the project directly in Eclipse.


4. Further information
======================
Always check out the documentation of the source code file that you are 
interested in. In addition to that, also check out the other README files 
for more information.
